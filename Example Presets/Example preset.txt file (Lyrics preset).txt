Example of how to make a preset file above
This is an example of a preset i use when writing lyrics

keep your task related files in a task_related_apps variable, use the semicolon (:) to seperate key and value
use the bundle_id of apps when adding to task_related_apps
only use quotation marks ("") at the beginning and end
you can use this apple script to find bundle_ids

tell application "System Events" to get bundle identifier of (first application process whose name is "Name of application")
